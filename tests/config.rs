//! The layered configuration, exercised through the names an operator actually sets.
//!
//! `terrace-config` owns the layering and tests it; what these pin is that this crate wires it
//! to the right variables, and that the blocks deserialise with the defaults documented in
//! `README.md` — which is why the expected values below are literals rather than references to
//! the constants that produce them.
//!
//! Every name is derived from [`config::terrace`] rather than spelled out, because the harness
//! is built over the loader the process itself boots through. A test that wrote
//! `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_DISCORD__WEBHOOK_URL_FILE` by hand would keep passing after the loader
//! stopped reading it, while testing a variable nothing sets.
//!
//! These live in a test binary of their own rather than beside the code, because the harness
//! manipulates the *process* environment: it starts each jail with an empty one, which unsets
//! `TMP` along with everything else, and a `tempfile` call on another test thread then has
//! nowhere to write. A separate binary is a separate process, so the isolation is real rather
//! than a convention future tests have to remember.
