CI renders it on every pull request and commits the result back to the branch. A push to master
whose README.md does not match its template fails the `README` job in

The configuration half of the payload comes from one command:

## What this is

One process. It polls the netcup deals RSS feed at <https://www.netcup.com/rss/deals/de> and
posts each item it has not seen before to a Discord webhook, as an embed carrying the title,
description, link, publication date and categories.

Seen is decided by publication date. After every round the newest `pubDate` is written to
`./data/feed_state.json`, and an item dated at or before it is skipped. A process that starts
without that file holds no watermark, so it posts everything the feed currently lists.

The configuration table below is generated from the Rust types that load the configuration. So
are [docs/config.contract.json](docs/config.contract.json) and the `dev.terrace.config.*` labels
every image carries, which is what lets a chart be checked against the keys the image reads
rather than against a copy of this page.

## Quick start

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_DISCORD__WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." \
  -e NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_FEED__CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS=900 \
  -v netcup-offer-bot-data:/app/data \
  timmi6790/netcup-offer-bot:v3.3.1
```

Those two variables are the only required keys. The volume holds the watermark; drop it and
every restart reposts whatever the feed still lists.

## Features

- **The webhook can arrive as a file.** `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_<KEY>_FILE` names a path, and a secrets
  directory supplies one key per file, so a mounted Kubernetes `Secret` reaches the process
  without the URL turning up in `docker inspect` or in a child process environment.
- A key supplied by two of the environment, the secrets directory and `_FILE` indirection fails
  the boot naming both sources. Resolving it by precedence would let a stale variable go on
  shadowing a webhook that has since been rotated.
- Delivery retries five times. A `429` waits out the `retry-after` header plus a second; a `5xx`
  or a connection failure backs off two seconds, then four, then eight. The fifth failure gives
  up on that item and counts it.
- A feed payload that does not begin with an `rss` tag is logged as a warning instead of counted
  as a fetch error, because the upstream answers with an HTML page often enough that alerting on
  it would be alerting on netcup's bad minute.
- Four Prometheus metrics, on an exporter that binds `127.0.0.1:9184` by default.
- Errors reach Sentry when `telemetry.sentry.enabled` is set, with performance tracing under
  `telemetry.sentry.traces_sample_rate` and the issue and breadcrumb thresholds as keys of their
  own. Switched on without a usable DSN it fails the boot rather than running as a reporter that
  reports nowhere. The image build uploads debug symbols before it strips the binary, so a musl
  release build still symbolicates.

## Installation

### Docker

```bash
docker pull timmi6790/netcup-offer-bot:v3.3.1
```

Published as a multi-platform manifest for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Every release is
pushed by digest, signed with cosign, and carries its configuration contract as an OCI referrer
on that digest. Pin by digest in production. The Helm chart does.

### Helm

```bash
helm repo add timschoenle https://timschoenle.github.io/helm-charts
helm install netcup-offer-bot timschoenle/netcup-offer-bot
```

The chart pins the image by digest, and this repository's release workflow bumps it. Its values
are at
[TimSchoenle/helm-charts](https://github.com/TimSchoenle/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/netcup-offer-bot).

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimSchoenle/netcup-offer-bot.git
cd netcup-offer-bot
cargo build --release
```

`--no-default-features` drops the `sentry` feature, and with it the client, the panic hook and
the `tracing` layer — a binary with no error-reporting path out of the process at all. It reads
the same `telemetry.sentry` keys and refuses to boot on `telemetry.sentry.enabled`, rather than
starting as a reporter it has no client for.

## Usage

The binary takes no arguments. Everything it reads is configuration, and the two required keys
have to come from somewhere before it starts:

```bash
NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_DISCORD__WEBHOOK_URL_FILE=./webhook \
NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_FEED__CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS=900 \
  cargo run --release
```

It writes `./data/feed_state.json` relative to the working directory and creates the directory
when it is missing.

Run the checks CI runs:

```bash
just verify            # fmt, clippy, test
```

After changing a configuration key, rewrite what is generated from it:

```bash
just regenerate        # docs/config.contract.json and the Dockerfile LABEL region
```

## Configuration

Configuration is layered by [terrace-config](https://github.com/TimSchoenle/terrace-config).
Lowest precedence first:

1. The defaults compiled into the config structs.
2. TOML at `$NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_CONFIG`, defaulting to `./config.toml`. A file, or every `*.toml`
   directly inside it when it names a directory, merged in file-name order. A missing file is
   not an error.
3. `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_`-prefixed environment variables.
4. Every key-named file in `$NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_SECRETS_DIR`.
5. `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_<KEY>_FILE=/path`, which reads the value from that path.

The last three are mutually exclusive per key. Two of them supplying one key fails the boot,
naming the key and both sources.

Nesting is `__`, because a single underscore is part of a field name. Case is folded, so
`discord.webhook_url` is `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_DISCORD__WEBHOOK_URL` as a variable and
`discord__webhook_url` as a file name.

| TOML | Type | Environment | Default | Flags | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `discord.webhook_url` | `SecretString` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_DISCORD__WEBHOOK_URL` | — | required, secret | Discord webhook the offers are posted to. |
| `feed.check_interval_secs` | `u64` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_FEED__CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS` | — | required | Seconds between two RSS feed checks. |
| `metrics.ip` | `IpAddr` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_METRICS__IP` | `127.0.0.1` | — | Address the Prometheus exporter binds. `0.0.0.0` to reach it from outside the container. |
| `metrics.port` | `u16` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_METRICS__PORT` | `9184` | — | Port the Prometheus exporter listens on. |
| `telemetry.log_level` | `LogLevel`: `error` \| `warn` \| `info` \| `debug` \| `trace` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | — | The maximum verbosity that reaches stdout: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` or `trace`. |
| `telemetry.sentry.enabled` | `bool` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__ENABLED` | `false` | — | Initialise the Sentry client. `false` installs no client, no panic hook and no layer, so every other key here is inert and nothing leaves the process. |
| `telemetry.sentry.dsn` | `SecretString` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__DSN` | unset | secret | Ingest URL, `https://<key>@<host>/<project>`. Required once `enabled` is set. |
| `telemetry.sentry.environment` | `String` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__ENVIRONMENT` | unset | — | Environment tag on every event. Defaults to `production`, or `development` for a debug build. |
| `telemetry.sentry.release` | `String` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__RELEASE` | unset | — | Release tag on every event. Defaults to the version the binary was built from. |
| `telemetry.sentry.server_name` | `String` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__SERVER_NAME` | unset | — | Host tag on every event. Unset, Sentry reports none. |
| `telemetry.sentry.sample_rate` | `f32` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__SAMPLE_RATE` | `1` | — | Fraction of captured events actually sent, `0.0`–`1.0`. |
| `telemetry.sentry.traces_sample_rate` | `f32` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | `0` | — | Fraction of traces that are recorded, `0.0`–`1.0`. `0.0` records none. |
| `telemetry.sentry.capture_level` | `SentryLevel`: `off` \| `error` \| `warn` \| `info` \| `debug` \| `trace` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__CAPTURE_LEVEL` | `error` | — | Least severe `tracing` level reported as a Sentry issue: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` or `trace`. |
| `telemetry.sentry.breadcrumb_level` | `SentryLevel`: `off` \| `error` \| `warn` \| `info` \| `debug` \| `trace` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__BREADCRUMB_LEVEL` | `info` | — | Least severe `tracing` level kept as a breadcrumb — the trail attached to the next issue. |
| `telemetry.sentry.max_breadcrumbs` | `usize` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__MAX_BREADCRUMBS` | `100` | — | How many breadcrumbs one event carries. |
| `telemetry.sentry.attach_stacktraces` | `bool` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__ATTACH_STACKTRACES` | `true` | — | Attach a stack trace to events that carry none of their own. |
| `telemetry.sentry.shutdown_timeout_secs` | `u64` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `2` | — | How long process exit waits for queued events to drain. |
| `telemetry.sentry.debug` | `bool` | `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__SENTRY__DEBUG` | `false` | — | Print the SDK's own diagnostics to stderr. For proving a DSN works, not for running. |

Run with `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_TELEMETRY__LOG_LEVEL=debug` and the boot log names the layer every
key was read from. That is what answers "the `Secret` is mounted and the bot is still posting to
the old webhook".

[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) has the rest: the two variables the loader reads
before any layer exists, both further spellings of every key, a `config.toml` carrying all of
them, the secrets-directory recipes, and the contract each image publishes.

## Operations

### Metrics

The Prometheus exporter serves `/metrics` on the address `metrics.ip` and `metrics.port` name,
`127.0.0.1:9184` unless configured otherwise. Bind `0.0.0.0` to reach it from outside the
container.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Reports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `feed_counter` | counter | `feed` | Items a round found to be new, counted before they are sent |
| `feed_fetch_duration_seconds` | histogram | `feed` | Seconds one fetch of the feed took |
| `feed_fetch_errors_total` | counter | `feed` | Fetches that failed, malformed payloads excluded |
| `webhook_errors_total` | counter | `feed` | Items still undelivered after the fifth attempt |

### Error reporting and tracing

Off unless `telemetry.sentry.enabled` is set. On, the process reports issues at
`telemetry.sentry.capture_level`, attaches the records above `telemetry.sentry.breadcrumb_level`
as the trail behind each one, and records the fraction of traces
`telemetry.sentry.traces_sample_rate` names — `0.0`, none, by default. Both thresholds are
independent of `telemetry.log_level`, so an issue raised from an `ERROR` still arrives with the
round that led to it attached however quiet stdout is.

Switched on without a usable DSN, an unparseable DSN or a rate outside `0.0`–`1.0` fails the
boot. [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#telemetrysentry) has the rest, including the
key this replaced and what a `--no-default-features` build does instead.

### State

`./data/feed_state.json` holds one UTC timestamp per feed and is rewritten only by a round that
moved one. The image's working directory is `/app`, so the file a deployment has to keep is
`/app/data/feed_state.json`.

### Runtime posture

The runtime stage is `FROM scratch`. It carries the stripped binary, the CA bundle, the zone
database, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group` and the offline copy of the configuration contract at
`/config/contract.json`. The process runs as `1001:1001` and writes to `/app/data` and stdout,
nothing else.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Commit messages follow Conventional Commits, which is what
release-please reads to decide the next version, and `just verify` runs the checks a pull request
is going to run anyway.

Four things here are generated, and each names its source in its first lines: `README.md`,
`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/config.contract.json` and the `LABEL` region of the `Dockerfile`.
`just regenerate` rewrites the last two. CI renders the first two, commits the result back to the
branch, and fails a push to master that does not match.

## Security

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) has the reporting
route and the supported versions.

The Discord webhook is the one credential this process holds, and anyone holding it can post to
the channel. Supply it as a file rather than as an environment variable.
