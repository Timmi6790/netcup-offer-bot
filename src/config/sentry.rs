//! Described unconditionally, and deliberately so. The client behind these keys is behind the
//! `sentry` feature, but the *keys* are not: a contract that gained and lost rows with a build
//! flag would stop being one document a chart can be checked against. A build without the
//! feature reads the same block and refuses to boot on [`SentryConfig::enabled`], which is the
//! honest answer — see `src/telemetry/sentry.rs`.
//!
//! # The doc comments below are documentation output
//!
//! As everywhere in [`super`]: the first paragraph of each field is the README table's cell and
//! is written for an operator setting the value. Anything under it is for whoever reads the
