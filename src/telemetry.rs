//! The subscriber this process logs through, and the Sentry client that shares its record stream.
//!
//! One call, [`init`], because the two are one installation: the layer reports onto the client,
//! and the client has to exist before the subscriber that feeds it. Both are process-global and
//! installed once, which is why `telemetry.*` is the block a running process cannot be told to
//! re-read.
//!
//! # Two filters, on purpose
//!
//! stdout is filtered at [`log_level`](crate::config::TelemetryConfig::log_level) and Sentry at
//! its own thresholds, and neither governs the other. The layer goes on collecting `INFO`
//! breadcrumbs however quiet stdout has been told to be, so an issue raised from an `ERROR`
//! still arrives with the round that led to it attached — which is the whole value of a
//! breadcrumb trail and would be lost the moment one filter sat above both.
