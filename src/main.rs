//! The process the container runs: a boot sequence, then one round per tick.
//!
//! Boot order is the load-bearing part. The configuration is read before the tracing subscriber
//! exists, because the log level is one of the keys it carries, so a failure there is reported by
//! `main`'s `Termination` and by nothing else. Everything installed after it is installed once: a
//! changed log level or a rotated Sentry DSN reaches the process on the next restart and not
//! before.
//!
//! Nothing after boot ends the process. A round logs and counts whatever it hits, and the interval
//! stream has no end, so the `Ok(())` below is unreachable and the container exits only when it is
//! stopped or when it panics.
//!
//! Ticks keep tokio's default burst behaviour: a round that runs longer than the interval is
//! followed immediately by the next one instead of being skipped.
