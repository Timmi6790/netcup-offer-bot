//! The typed configuration surface, and the loader every run boots through.
//!
//! The layering is [`terrace_config`]'s. Lowest precedence first: the `serde` defaults compiled
//! into the structs below, TOML at `$NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_CONFIG` (default `./config.toml`, absent
//! is not an error), `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_`-prefixed `__`-nested environment variables, every
//! key-named file in `$NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_SECRETS_DIR`, and `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_<KEY>_FILE`
//! indirection.
//!
//! The point of the last two is that the Discord webhook — the one credential this process
//! holds — can arrive as a mounted Kubernetes `Secret` or a Docker secret file rather than as
//! an environment variable that shows up in `docker inspect` and in every child process's
//! environment.
//!
//! Every layer spells a field the same way: `__` separates nesting levels and case is folded,
//! so `discord.webhook_url` is `NETCUP_OFFER_BOT_DISCORD__WEBHOOK_URL` as a variable and
//! `discord__webhook_url` as a file name.
//!
//! # The doc comments below are documentation output
//!
//! Under the `config-schema` feature these structs also derive `Describe`, and the
//! configuration tables in `README.md` are generated from what it reports: every key path,
//! every environment spelling, every default, and the *first paragraph* of each field's doc
//! comment. Write that paragraph for an operator setting the value. Anything below it stays
//! here, for whoever reads the type.
//!
// Gated rather than written as `//!`, because the link below is to an item that only exists
// under the feature and `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links` is denied. The section renders in the

# The contract this image publishes

Under the same feature, [`contract`] renders these types as the document the container build
embeds in the image and attaches to its pushed digest, and the `dev.terrace.config.*` labels
that make it discoverable. A key added below is a key the deployment side learns about in the
same commit; `docs/config.contract.json` is the committed copy, and CI fails a pull request
that changes one without the other.
